# users-api

I followed the loom video guides and used the disc template on github to write the config.js and server.js files. I also used Postman to check the requests I make to the database. Making the api repo helped me gain a better understanding of how the frontend sends requests to the api, which retrieves data from the backend and returns it to the frontend.
